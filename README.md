## Mission Statement:
Machine Learning (ML) is becoming increasingly applicable to medical problems. From advancing scientific research, to providing clinical decision and diagnostic support, to optimizing healthcare delivery and efficiency, machine learning holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare. We believe that equipping future physicians and leaders in medicine (Duke Med students) with a background knowledge in ML and data science will be valuable for interfacing with and perhaps developing new healthcare tools. Therefore, we are forming the Machine Learning in Medicine (MLiM) student group to provide a space for Duke Med students to enrich their medical education with topics in ML and data science.

## Proposed Events:
* Beginner-friendly Coding Workshops
* Hackathons/Github Build Sessions
* Roundtable of current ML research projects/Networking with upperclass students
